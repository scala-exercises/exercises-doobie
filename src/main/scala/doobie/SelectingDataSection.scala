/**
 * We are going to construct some programs that retrieve data from the database and stream it back,
 * mapping to Scala types on the way.
 *
 * We will be playing with the country table that has the following structure:
 * {{{
 * CREATE TABLE country (
 * code       character(3)  NOT NULL,
 * name       text          NOT NULL,
 * population integer       NOT NULL,
 * gnp        numeric(10,2)
 * )
 * }}}
 *
 * For the exercises, the ''country'' table will contain:
 * {{{
 * code    name                      population    gnp
 * "DEU"  "Germany"                    82164700    2133367.00
 * "ESP"  "Spain"                      39441700          null
 * "FRA"  "France"                     59225700    1424285.00
 * "GBR"  "United Kingdom"             59623400    1378330.00
 * "USA"  "United States of America"  278357000    8510700.00
 * }}}
 *
 * == How to select data ==
 *
 * As we commented in the previous section, the `sql` string interpolator allows us to create a
 * query to select data from the database.
 *
 * For instance, `sql"select name from country".query[String]` defines a `Query0[String]`, which
 * is a one-column query that maps each returned row to a String.
 *
 * `.to[List]` is a convenience method that accumulates rows into a `List`, in this case yielding a
 * `ConnectionIO[List[String]]`. It works with any collection type that has a `CanBuildFrom`. Similar methods are:
 * - `.unique` which returns a single value, raising an exception if there is not exactly one row returned.
 * - `.option` which returns an `Option`, raising an exception if there is more than one row returned.
 * - `.nel` which returns a `NonEmptyList`, raising an exception if there are no rows returned.
 * See the Scaladoc for Query0 for more information on these and other methods.
